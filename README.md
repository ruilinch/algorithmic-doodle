## python trials on implementing algorithms

#### This is a folder that stores my python implementations of various algorithms, which is inspired by the Coursera course on Algorithm.
#### A "might-not-be-readily-updated" list of things that I have worked out:
* Quick-find, Quick-union and the weighted quick-union with path compression for connected components 
  - Application: determine the threshold probability for a square to be connected/percolation
* BinarySearch
  - Application: compare files against whitelists, store gap values in a new file
* Math functions:
  - Number: get greatest common divisor, absolute value, square root
  - Number array/list: get maximum value, average value; random shuffle; reverse order
  - Number matrix: transpose; multiply
